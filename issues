Origin not allowed 
 when accessing Grafana UI login can be made successfully, but you cannot make any post request(save changes)
 
 grafana is running behind nginx ingress with Go Daddy Domain
 Go Daaddy Domain is added as backed pool host to Azure Front Door
 
 
 
solution:

The header which is passing from Front Door to ingress is different from the host(spec.host) configured in ingress rules.

so, add engines rules to front door routing rules, modifying the header to ingress host

       condition      HeaderName   Operator    Header Value
if    request header   Origin        contains     https://fronthost.azurefd.net


            action      HeaderName   Operator    Header Value
then    request header   Origin      overwrites   https://GodaddyDomain or ingress host




incase WAF policy is enabled with preventation mode

then add custom rules 

operator regex

match value:  domain
